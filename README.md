# Resume as a Website and API

Display a resume as a website and an API


**Link to project:** coming soon



## How It's Made:

Simple express server created in Node.js to display a javascript object as an HTML page using EJS


**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, EJS


Created a class Resume which takes in professional information
Used EJS to render all of the information from the resume object
Added routes for all of the API endpoints
Added some simple style


## Optimizations


Documentation should be added so users know how to interact with the API
The style could be improved to match a standard resume format and improve readability
Exception handling could be added for any missing fields
A form could be added so the user can upload their own resume without going into the code


## Lessons Learned:

When building out an API you can really go wild with the routes and include one for every piece of information
